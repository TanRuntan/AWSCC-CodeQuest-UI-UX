You've made itâ€”great job! Now, here's the scoop: this markdown file is your **canvas**. Customize it; let your creativity flow!

Remember, you're free to add your personal touch, but keep the sacred requirements intact; they are the guardians of order here. This markdown file should include:
- Link to your own file of **"Figma Basics Tutorial"**
- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection

Ready to include your output for **Day 2**? Let the customization begin! ðŸš€âœ¨

<!-- You may now delete and modify the content of this file -->

**Works**
